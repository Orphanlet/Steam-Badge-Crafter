# Steam Badge Craft

This is a script to craft badges automatically in your browser so you don't have to keep navigating back to your badge craft screen or wait for long animations to complete. To be able to run this script in a browser, you will need Tampermonkey. You can download it on your browsers respective extension/add-on toolbar.

# Adding the Extension

If you're on chrome or firefox, head over to extensions and enable developer mode. Then import the .js script into your extensions. Restart your browser. If upon restart you see a new extension icon for Badge Crafter then you've successfully installed it. Otherwise, try again.
